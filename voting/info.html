			<h1> Welcome to my Voting App</h1>
			<div>
				<h2> Objective: </h2>
				<p> 
					1) Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2> Reference: </h2>
				<p> 
					1) Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-back-end-development-projects.
				</p>

				<h2> User Stories: </h2>
				<p> 
					1) As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
				</p>
				<p> 
					2) As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
				</p>
				<p> 
					3) As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
				</p>
				<p> 
					4) As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
				</p>
				<p> 
					5)  As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
				</p>
				<p> 
					6) As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
				</p>
				<p> 
					7) As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
				</p>
				<p> 
					8) As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
